# How to cut a Pony release

This document is aimed at members of the Pony team who might be cutting a release of Pony. It serves as a checklist that can take you through doing a release step-by-step.

## Prerequisites for doing any release

In order to do a release, you absolutely must have:

* Commit access to the `ponyc` repo
* The latest release of the [changelog tool](https://github.com/ponylang/changelog-tool/releases) installed
* Access to the ponylang twitter account
* Accounts on reddit/hacker news/lobste.rs/ponylang irc for posting release notes

While not strictly required, your life will be made much easier if you:

* Have a [bintray account](https://bintray.com/) and have been granted access `pony-language` organization by a "release admin".
* Have read and write access to the ponylang [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) account
* Have read and write access to the ponylang [appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com) account
* Have read and write access to the ponylang [dockerhub organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/ponylang/dashboard/)

## Prerequisites for specific releases

Before getting started, you will need a number for the version that you will be releasing as well as an agreed upon "golden commit" that will form the basis of the release.  Any commit is eligible to be a "golden commit" so long as:

* It passed all CI checks

While not strictly necessary, it is recommended to ensure one of the following to confirm that packaging isn't broken:

* Confirm that the last Travis CI daily cron triggered jobs ran successfully (https://travis-ci.org/ponylang/ponyc/builds)
* Manually kick off a run via an "API request" using the "Trigger Build" functionality in the Travis Web UI and wait to confirm all the jobs run successfully (https://travis-ci.org/ponylang/ponyc/builds)

Both of these go through the motions to build all the packages we normally create to confirm there aren't any issues. While this will not guarantee no errors in other parts of the "release" CI run, it does confirm that there will not be any packaging related errors.

If these jobs are not passing, you should get the issues resolved prior to releasing as both DEB and RPM packaging work off of the tag in GitHub and any changes or fixes made after tagging will not be included and will require a new release to be tagged.

### Validate external services are functional

We rely on both Travis CI and Appveyor as part of our release process. Both need to be up and functional in order to do a release. Check the status of each before starting a release. If either is reporting issues, push the release back a day or until whenever they both are reporting no problems.

* [Travis CI Status](https://www.traviscistatus.com)
* [Appveyor Status](https://appveyor.statuspage.io)
* [COPR Build System](https://status.fedoraproject.org/)
* [Bintray Status](http://status.bintray.com)

### A GitHub issue exists for the release

All releases should have a corresponding issue in the [ponyc repo](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues). This issue should be used to communicate the progress of the release (updated as checklist steps are completed). You can also use the issue to notify other pony team members of problems.

## Releasing

Please note that the release script was written with the assumption that you are using a clone of the `ponylang/ponyc` repo. You have to be using a clone rather than a fork. Further, due to how git works, you need to make sure that both your `master` and `release` branches are up-to-date. It is advised to your do this but making a fresh clone of the ponyc repo from which you will release. For example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ponylang/ponyc.git ponyc-release-clean
cd ponyc-release-clean
```

For the duration of this document, we will pretend the "golden commit" version is `8a8ee28` and the version is `0.3.1`. Any place you see those values, please substitute your own version.

With that in mind, run the release script:

- bash release.bash 0.3.1 8a8ee28

If the golden commit does not include the most recent CHANGELOG updates, you will have to answer `n` to the second prompt and merge the changes manually.

### Update the GitHub issue

Leave a comment on the GitHub issue for this release to let everyone know you are done versioning the CHANGELOG and VERSION and that they are updated on `master`.

### "Update" PRs for CHANGELOG

Go through all open PRs and check to see if they are updating the CHANGELOG. If they are, leave a note asking them to merge the latest CHANGELOG into their branch because of the recent versioning for release and to move their additions into the appropriate area of "unreleased".

### Add CHANGELOG entries to GitHub releases

By now GitHub should have a listing of this new release under [releases](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/releases). Click the `0.3.1` then do "Edit Release". Paste the CHANGELOG entries for this release into the box and update.

### Update Homebrew

Fork the [homebrew-core repo](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) and then clone it locally. You are going to be editing "Formula/ponyc.rb". If you already have a local copy of homebrew-core, make sure you sync up with the main Homebrew repo otherwise you might change an older version of the formula and end up with merge conflicts.

Make sure you do your changes on a branch:

* git checkout -b ponyc-0.3.1

HomeBrew has [directions](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-a-123-version-upgrade-for-the-foo-formula) on what specifically you need to update in a formula to account for an upgrade. If you are on OSX and are unsure of how to get the SHA of the release .tar.gz, download the release file (make sure it does unzip it) and run `shasum -a 256 ponyc-0.3.1.tar.gz`. If you are on OSX, its quite possible it will try to unzip the file on your. In Safari, right clicking and selecting "Download Linked File" will get your the complete .tar.gz.

After updating the ponyc formula, push to your fork and open a PR against homebrew-core. According to the homebrew team, their preferred naming for such PRs is `ponyc 0.3.1` that is, the name of the formula being updated followed by the new version number.

### Update the GitHub issue

Leave a comment on the GitHub issue for this release letting everyone know that the Homebrew formula has been updated and a PR issued. Leave a link to your open PR.

### "Kick off" the Gentoo release

Leave a comment on the GitHub issue for this release letting @stefantalpalaru know that a release is underway. He maintains the Gentoo release. We think it involves magic, but aren't really sure.

### "Kick off" the Nix release

There's no real Nix release. However, @kamilchm is maintaining Nix Pony packages. Drop him a note on the GitHub issue so he is aware of the release.

### Update the GitHub issue as needed

At this point we are basically waiting on Travis, Appveyor and Homebrew. As each finishes, leave a note on the GitHub issue for this release letting everyone know where we stand status wise. For example: "Release 0.3.1 is now available via Homebrew".

### Work on the release notes

We do a blog post announcing each release. The release notes blog post should include highlights of any particularly interesting changes that we want the community to be aware of. 

Additionally, any breaking changes that require end users to change their code should be discussed and examples of how to update their code should be included.

[Examples of prior release posts](https://www.ponylang.io/categories/release) are available. If you haven't written release notes before, you should review prior examples to get a feel what should be included. ([example](https://github.com/ponylang/ponylang.github.io/pull/284/files))

### Wait on Travis and Appveyor

During the time since you push to the release branch, Travis CI and Appveyor have been busy building release artifacts. This can take up to a couple hours depending on how busy they are. Periodically check bintray to see if the releases are there yet.

* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ponylang/ponyc/builds) (confirm that the Travis jobs for the `release` branch ran successfully)
* [AppImage](https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponylang-appimage/ponyc)
* [Debian](https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponylang-debian/ponyc)

The pattern for releases is similar as what we previously saw. In the case of Deb, the version looks something like:

`0.3.1`

It is recommended to check the files for the Deb version to ensure that every distribution we support has a file successfully uploaded.

For AppImage, the versions look something like:

`0.3.1`

* [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ponylang/ponyc/history) (confirm that Appveyor jobs ran successfully for at least the LLVM 3.9.1/Release job)
* [Windows](https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-win/ponyc)

For windows, the versions look something like:

`ponyc-release-0.3.1-1526.8a8ee28`

where the `1526` is the AppVeyor build number and the `8a8ee28` is the abbreviated SHA for the commit we built from.

### Wait on COPR

The Travis CI build for the release branch kicks off packaging builds on Fedora COPR. These packaging builds can take some time but are usually quick. Periodically check to see if the releases are finished and published on this site:

* [Fedora COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ponylang/ponylang/builds/)

The pattern for packaging release builds is similar as what we previously saw. The version looks something like:

`0.3.1-1.fc27` (confirm `status` is `succeeded`)

### Wait on Homebrew

Periodically check on your Homebrew PR. They have a CI process and everything should flow through smoothly. If it doesn't attempt to fix the problem. If you can't fix the problem, leave a comment on the GitHub issue for this release asking for assistance.

Your PR will be closed once your change has been merged to master. Note, that your PR itself will not show as merged in GitHub- just closed. You can use the following command to verify that your change is on Homebrew master:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/master/Formula/ponyc.rb | grep url
```

If the formulae has been successfully updated, you'll see the new download url in the output of the command. If it hasn't, you'll see the old url.

Note that its often quite quick to get everything through Homebrew's CI and merge process, however its often quite slow as well. We've seen their Jenkins CI often fail with errors that are unrelated to PR in question. Don't wait too long on Homebrew. If it hasn't passed CI and been merged within a couple hours move ahead without it having passed. If Homebrew is being slow about merging, when you inform IRC and pony-user of the release, note that the Homebrew version isn't available yet and include a link to the Homebrew PR and the ponyc Github release issue so that people can follow along. When the Homebrew PR is eventually merged, update pony-user and IRC.

### Wait on Docker images to be built

As part of every release, 3 docker images are built:

- latest
- release
- and a release version such as 0.3.1

Visit the ponylang dockerhub organization [build page](https://hub.docker.com/r/ponylang/ponyc/builds/) and verify that all 3 images were successfully built.

### Verify that the Pony Playground updated to the new version

Once the dockerhub images have been updated, visit the [Pony Playground](https://playground.ponylang.io/) and verify that it has been updated to the correct version by compiling some code and checking the compiler version number in the output.

### Merge the release blog post PR for the ponylang website

Once all the release steps have been confirmed as successful, merge the PR you created earlier for ponylang.github.io for the blog post announcing the release. Confirm it is successfully published to the [blog](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/).

### Inform #ponylang

Once Travis, Appveyor and Homebrew are all finished, drop a note in the #ponylang IRC channel (on freenode) letting everyone know that the release is out and include a link the release blog post. ([example](https://irclog.whitequark.org/ponylang/2018-05-26#22183154;))

If this is an "emergency release" that is designed to get a high priority bug fix out, be sure to note that everyone is advised to update ASAP. If the high priority bug only affects certain platforms, adjust the "update ASAP" note accordingly.

### Inform pony-user

Once Travis, Appveyor and Homebrew are all finished, send an email to the [pony user](https://pony.groups.io/g/user) mailing list letting everyone know that the release is out and include a link the release blog post. ([example](https://pony.groups.io/g/user/topic/pony_0_22_2_has_been_released/20332095))

If this is an "emergency release" that is designed to get a high priority bug fix out, be sure to note that everyone is advised to update ASAP. If the high priority bug only affects certain platforms, adjust the "update ASAP" note accordingly.

### Add to "Last Week in Pony"

Last Week in Pony is our weekly newsletter. Add information about the release, including a link to the release notes, to the [current Last Week in Pony](https://github.com/ponylang/ponylang.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alast-week-in-pony). ([example](https://github.com/ponylang/ponylang.github.io/issues/282#issuecomment-392230067))
